![" "](https://media1.tenor.com/m/ZDc91TS5Wi4AAAAC/wow-cewl.gif)

This project focuses on the implementation and management of firewall systems. Firewalls are crucial for securing network infrastructure by controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Through these tasks, I have established the fundamental knowledge to create a secure firewall configuration that protects the server from unauthorized access while allowing necessary communications to flow.

## Tasks Table

| Task Name | Files | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 0. Block all incoming traffic but | [0-block_all_incoming_traffic_but](./0-block_all_incoming_traffic_but) | Configure the server so that it blocks all incoming traffic except for specific ports. |
| 1. Port forwarding | [100-port_forwarding](./100-port_forwarding) | Set up port forwarding to redirect traffic from one port to another. |
