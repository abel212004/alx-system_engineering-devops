This project is designed to explore the world of APIs, such as data retrieval, parsing, and authentication. Specifically, this project focuses on the Reddit API, which is a popular platform for sharing and discussing content on the internet. In this project, I learned how to read API documentation to find the endpoints I'm looking for, how to use an API with pagination, how to parse JSON results from an API, how to make a recursive API call, and how to sort a dictionary by value
