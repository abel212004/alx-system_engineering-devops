This project is part of a series of web stack debugging projects. The goal of this project is to help developers learn how to debug and fix issues in a web server environment. In this project, I had to debug a misbehaving Apache server using `strace` and Puppet. The Apache server was not responding to requests, and I had to use `strace` to figure out what was wrong. After identifying the problem, I used Puppet to debug the error and fix the issue.
